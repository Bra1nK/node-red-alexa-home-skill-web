      <h1>Documentation</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the Node-RED Alexa Home Skill Bridge documentation</p>
      
      <h2 id="createAccount">Create Account</h2>
      <p>Before you start the first thing that needs to be done is to create an account on this site.
      You can do this by clicking <a href="/newuser">here</a></p>
      <p>After you have created an account you need to define some devices to control. Once you are 
      logged ina "Devices" tab should appear in the menu at the top of the page. From here you can 
      add new, edit or delete existing devices.</p>
      <img width="1133" height="276" src="/images/devices.png">
      The name you give to the device will be how you access it from Alexa.
      
      <h2 id="linkAccount">Link Account</h2>
      <p>Once you have an account you need to add the Skill to your Alexa powered device. You can do 
      this from Alexa app on your phone/tablet by searching for 'Node-RED' in the Skills section. Once
      enabled you will be asked to link your account. This will ask for the same username and password
      you used when you created the account here.</p>
      <p>Once the accounts are linked you can discover the devices you declared earlier.</p>
      
      <h2 id="installNodes">Install Nodes</h2>
      <p>Now that the Echo side of things is all setup it's time to set up Node-RED.</p>
      <p>node-red-contrib-alexa-home-skill provides the end point node to bring your commands into Node-RED.</p>
      <p>There are serveral ways to install new nodes into Node-RED</p>
      <p>The simplest is to use the installer built into the Node-RED admin UI.</p>
      <p>You can also install the nodes from the command line</p>
      <pre>
cd ~/.node-red
npm install node-red-contrib-alexa-home-skill</pre>
      <p>And finally if you are embedding Node-RED into your own application you can add the node to 
      the package.json file for your project and it will be included when you do an install.</p>
      <pre>
...
  "dependencies": {
    "node-red": "~0.15.x",
    "node-red-contrib-alexa-home-skill": "*",
...</pre>
      
      <h2 id="configNodes">Configure Nodes</h2>
      <p>Configuring the nodes is relatively simple, just enter your username and password into the config 
      node and then select the device you want to receive commands from.</p>
